# The manipulated

This is the Arduino car which is getting manipulated by you. Or in better wordings, you will be controlling the car with your brain.

## How does it work?
Well, the understanding of the car will be very simple, it gets a signal from "The Manipulator" or the AI to turn in whichever direction you are thinking of going in, and voila it does it. 

I think, I'll hardcode this whole car since its pretty simple and this won't be scaled to be ran for a wheelchair since that is more complicated and will have alot more to it and I have no intentions of doing that as of now. 

Tech stack: I think I'll use rust and some crates (Will be told soon)

## Targets
- [x] Get one LED to work
- [x] Get 4 LEDs to work
- [x] Send signal from laptop to arduino to selectively start up 
- [ ] Add shared control using an Ultrasonic sensor (Or an IR sensor)
- [ ] Gucci
