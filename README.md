# fuzzy-giggle

This is the implementation of each part of my year long capstone/research project(Mobility Facilitator for MND Patients).

This includes
    1. The menu to start the whole project (WIP)
    2. The model architecture -> The manipulator
    3. The implementation of the Arduino Car (WIP, I think it will be in Rust). The manipulated
    4. More features would be added later. I didn't want to feature creep 


## The Basic Pipeline
This is not the final deal and this readme will get edited alot of times as I progress through the project's coding part so keep a track of the readme's commit history. 

1. You put on the Emotiv-14X headsets and complete the setup process.
2. You connect the headsets to my project.
3. Train yourself and the model for yourself through the menu (There will be an option for that soon)
4. Start playing around if you don't want to visualize.
