# The Manipulator

Alright, So this is the code for the EEG model which classifies what your brain is thinking (**Note to the paranoid ones**: By thinking, the model only understands which direction you want to go towards. By no means can this model understand words or intentions).

## How does it work?
So, you may ask how does this model work? Isn't our brain this really complicated mess of celluar level random mixing (insert more words cause I got lazy) connections? Yes, that is true.

The way the brain works is through electricity. Now, electricity will generate electrical fields which can be recorded. Thats where the headsets come in play, they record the electrical fields generated by a bunch of neurons placed in specific parts of the brain placed. These electrical signals/waves are sent to the model in the form of numbers which get analyzed and some AI things happen (For those who understand who work in the field of programming, we have a neural network based on EEGNET which we will be using for now). The AI things then tells the computer "Oh, the master wants the slave to turn in left direction, tell the slave to turn in the left direction". Here the slave is our car and the master is you.

Perfect, now that I have laid down the gist of the whole model part, I'll drop a link to the proper explaination once this whole thing is ready.
